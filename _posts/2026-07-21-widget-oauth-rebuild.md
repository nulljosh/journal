## Tuesday (nightly wrap)

Fixed a systemic Mac widget bug across Talli and Epiphany: both were missing NSExtensionPointIdentifier in the widget's Info.plist, causing ITMS-90348 upload validation errors on App Store Connect. Added the missing key, re-archived both, and re-uploaded cleanly (talli commit 3feb0a4, epiphany commit 55f8665). Widget data sharing now works as intended on both platforms.

Wired Twitter/X OAuth keys into Epiphany on Vercel after re-activating the X developer account. Sign-in was previously disabled; now live in production. Tested end-to-end and committed the configuration.

Spine got renamed from "Spineless" to "Bindwise" after discovering "Spine" was already taken on the App Store. Icon export bug was also fixed (stale signing profile + missing UISupportedInterfaceOrientations in the project config), cleaned up in commit 531d730.

Healstack shipped v1.0 to App Store review. Medical device declaration was cleared via the asc web CLI—a regulated-category gate that has no programmatic path and requires manual dashboard interaction. The build is now in review (commit efbb929).

Lexly confirmed already merged: iOS and macOS are now a single universal app record after the xcodegen consolidation completed earlier (commit 67da0ac verified the cross-platform status). No code changes needed for the merge—just verification that it was already done.

Nullfolio (Portfolio iOS app) confirmed already submitted WAITING_FOR_REVIEW after the icon fix landed last session. The submission happened earlier; just needed status confirmation from ASC (commit 4e13221 logged the status grid).

Scoped a comprehensive Vercel to Cloudflare Pages migration plan (approved, saved to ~/.claude/plans/bright-baking-lake.md). 13–17 sessions planned; deferred for next session once usage headroom opens up. Roadmap logged the approval (commit 21f7a35).

Echo Mac submission attempted tonight (v1.3.3) but initially uploaded to the wrong ASC app (orphaned com.nulljosh.echo.mac, id 6783015101). Caught and cancelled; resubmitted correctly to the intended app (6782604262, submission id 841fabc3) with user confirmation. iOS 1.3.3 had already been submitted 2026-07-19. Universal Purchase merge is on track (both iOS and Mac now unified under app 6782604262).

Litigate iOS resubmitted as v1.0.1 build 4 with name fix, support URL, and account deletion feature (commit 2e6690e). App Review blockers remain on the macOS side (app record doesn't exist yet—needs creation, not re-ship).

Late night fix session on Talli: discovered the MARKETING_VERSION had gotten stuck at 3.5.5 even after 3.5.6 shipped, which was why Xcode Cloud and the App Store upload kept failing — fixed and submitted iOS 3.5.7 tonight. Also found a deeper Mac widget bug: TalliWidgets had no version override in the project config, so it was silently falling back to 1.0.0 instead of matching the main app's version, which caused validation errors. Fixed the version consolidation. However, the Mac build was initially uploaded to the wrong ASC app (6782661988, com.heyitsmejosh.tally.mac, which has an immutable bundle ID that can never unify with iOS). Corrected: fresh archive uploaded to the iOS app (6782366555, bundle com.heyitsmejosh.tally matches already). Build 8b29a831 is VALID there but not yet submitted — pending user confirmation, as iOS 3.5.7 is currently in review and the app record is locked. Cleaned up ~8400 lines of accidentally-committed build artifacts along the way. Caught a privacy bug on Mac: the `.task { appState.bootstrap() }` was running unconditionally during screenshot automation, which could load real BC Self-Serve credentials from Keychain instead of mock data—fixed by guarding both the task and bootstrap() itself to respect UITEST_SNAPSHOT mode. No real data reached Apple; the submitted screenshot was an earlier blank capture.

Submitted Spark Mac 1.0 for review tonight with a corrected app ID that had been stale in the workflow config (no issues encountered).

By the end of the night, I'd successfully unified four apps into single App Store listings with Universal Purchase support across iOS and macOS. Epiphany Mac 2.5.2 went in cleanly after fixing encryption declarations, age-rating fields, and screenshot sizing. Echo and Sparkjar's Mac builds merged without drama once I caught and fixed the initial wrong-app submission on Echo. Lexly's merge was already done in an earlier session, just needed confirmation. Talli's merge is correct but locked externally while iOS 3.5.7 finishes review — that one will ship once the version clears. One night, four platforms unified.

Final pass: ran roadmap pruning across the entire 16-app codebase to strip out completed `[x]` items (14 repos got roadmap.md updates). Verified the Obsidian vault sync is clean and all entity pages match current state. The wiki infrastructure got a fresh update earlier tonight (wiki-refresh skill wired into the nightly routine permanently), so master.md and the vault are now in sync.

Nightly wrap 2026-07-21 late (pre-midnight): Confirmed Echo iOS and macOS are truly unified under one app (6782604262). The iOS app had been sitting in rejection since 07-19 due to a button-state bug: when a network hiccup interrupted the purchase flow during Apple's review process, the "Unlock Echo Pro" button would freeze in a gray disabled state with no retry mechanism — users couldn't retry the unlock without restarting the app. Fixed by adding explicit retry logic, and also decided to ship the app fully unlocked (`isPro = true`) for v1 since there's no Paid Apps Agreement or bank account set up yet to actually collect payments; that gating will come back in v2 once the business side is sorted. Uploaded the corrected build tonight, but Apple's review system has a transient lock on the old rejected submission that won't release the app version yet — should clear in a few hours, plan to re-submit tomorrow morning. BC Garage Doors had an age-rating declaration missing (one of Apple's newer fields via regulatory updates), tracked down and fixed it via the ASC web API without needing the dashboard. Separately verified that Healstack, Sparkjar, and the Inkpress RSS-reader app are all further along than expected — all three are WAITING_FOR_REVIEW already, no additional work needed there for now.

## Wednesday

Started with a market briefing: Iran strikes escalating, Zelensky sacked his army commander, Congress punted the government shutdown fight past midterms, Arizona primaries went heavily Trump, and France banned social media for under-15s. Spent the rest of the evening investigating autotrading through Epiphany — specifically bridging Wealthsimple and SnapTrade (both read-only portfolio data feeds) with a live trading API to execute trades based on news signals. Discovered that neither Wealthsimple nor SnapTrade publish trade-execution APIs (Wealthsimple is internal-only, SnapTrade is aggregation + analytics), so the architecture needs a separate brokerage. Evaluated Alpaca (free paper trading, straightforward REST API, no Canadian equities but handles US stocks/crypto) versus Interactive Brokers (supports TSX/Canadian equities but heavier KYC setup and complexity). Documented the research in epiphany/roadmap.md as a concrete next step — Joshua wants to sign up for Alpaca himself tomorrow since account creation needs identity verification. The foundation for Alpaca integration is scoped; blocked on the account setup, not on our end.

Later, ran a codebase-wide README staleness sweep: consolidated the Litigate README which was still branded "Brief" with the old brief.heyitsmejosh.com domain from before the 2026-07-18 rename — a 4-day lag that caught zero eyes because GitHub doesn't flag docs-only drift. Updated Litigate's README title, domain link, and app status. Also bumped version badges on Talli (3.5.6 → 3.5.7 to match the submitted build), Echo (1.3.2 → 1.3.3), Lexly (1.1.0 → 1.1.1), and Healstack (2.1.1 → 2.3.4) to match current in-flight versions, and verified no drift on Sparkjar, Inkpress, Journal, Spine, Newsline, BCGD, NYC, Nimble, or the portfolio. Logged the sweep as complete in the root roadmap.md.
