## Friday

Finished setup for the stalled-loop diagnosis in pwnlingo: recorded the XP baseline, bounded repeated challenge retries, fixed language tile matching, and checkpointed the lesson fixes in place. The solver had been silent about what was breaking it.

## Saturday

Fixed pwnlingo's 23-hour stalled loop (1033 cycles, zero XP) by dismissing stalled stories, skipping blacklisted tracks, and fixing challenge shapes; 46 tests green. Shipped Joshua Tree kernel with glossy tiles, real syscalls, graphs, lazy v86 loading, and back buffer; onboarding went live on 11 apps, Lexly added worked examples. Updated dock check positions after pinning Stocks, but exposed a cascade: landing terminal gibberish, header out of sync, CI red (PR #6 pending), checks failing randomly, everything laggy, weather dead. Spent this morning debugging it and got frustrated; Joshua Tree broke and needs real fixes plus green CI before it's usable.

## Sunday

All eight shipped iOS apps built against iOS 27; epiphany needed a smaller chart expression to get past Swift's type checker, and I fixed the roadmap issue sync after it created 25 junk titles. Joshua Tree gained Search, a pinned Stocks icon, contrast fixes, release notes, a shorter roadmap, and an interactive landing page while I chased dock animation lag. I protected its main branch with required CI and pull requests, but the suite kept exposing brittle checks after the dock changed; the latest fix waits for the desktop before clicking, and all eleven apps passed locally. GitHub still has not finished checking the PR, the issue remains open, and the repository still has stale beta and stable branches.

**Apps**: pwnlingo, joshuatree, lexly, bookrank, costanza, curbfind, curvely, dream, epiphany, healstack, roost, sidewise, sparkjar, dotfiles
