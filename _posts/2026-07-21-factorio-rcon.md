## Tuesday

Tried building a live-spectate mode for Claude playing Factorio in your own world. Got the RCON control working and had Claude actually mining iron ore autonomously via LuaSocket commands, then hit a hard wall: the FLE tool's script injection breaks Factorio's multiplayer map sync. The moment a real player (you) tried to join the server, the deserialization crashed on unserializable Lua functions. Confirmed this is an architecture limitation, not fixable without a different approach (async screenshot mode instead of live client join). Abandoned it—pointless without live spectate. Enjoyed the technical deep dive though.
